# Contributing

[English](./CONTRIBUTING.md) | [简体中文](./CONTRIBUTING.zh-CN.md)

Welcome to contribute new skills or improve existing ones in `TopPerson`.

This repository accepts structured, AI-usable person-methodology skills rather than ordinary articles.

We care most about:

- source quality
- method extraction
- structural consistency
- modern translation and safety

## What Fits This Repository

Good submissions:

- a historical figure skill
- a modern person’s decision-making style skill
- source improvements or structural fixes for an existing skill
- clearer reference organization

Not a fit:

- plain biography
- biography summary without method extraction
- unsourced quote collection
- pseudoscience, manipulation, or unlawful guidance

## Minimum Skill Structure

Each skill should usually live under:

```text
.agents/skills/<skill-name>/
```

Minimum required files:

```text
.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
.agents/skills/<skill-name>/agents/openai.yaml
.agents/skills/<skill-name>/references/source-map.md
.agents/skills/<skill-name>/references/principles.md
```

Optional human-facing guide files:

```text
.agents/skills/<skill-name>/references/overview.en.md
.agents/skills/<skill-name>/references/overview.zh-CN.md
```

File roles:

- `SKILL.md`
  Main skill file describing purpose, triggers, and output style.
- `references/source-map.md`
  Source hierarchy: primary, secondary, and low-confidence materials.
- `references/principles.md`
  Distilled principles translated into modern actionable guidance.
- `references/overview.en.md`
  Optional English guide for repository visitors.
- `references/overview.zh-CN.md`
  Optional Simplified Chinese guide for repository visitors.
- `agents/openai.yaml`
  UI-facing and invocation metadata.

## Naming Rules

- Use lowercase hyphenated folder names such as `zeng-guofan`
- The `name` field in `SKILL.md` frontmatter must match the folder name
- Names should be short, stable, and predictable

## Content Rules

### 1. Prefer Primary Sources

Prefer:

- books by the person
- letters
- diaries
- speeches
- papers
- interviews
- verified public materials

If primary sources are limited, high-quality secondary research is acceptable, but explain that clearly in `source-map.md`.

### 2. Separate Source Confidence

At minimum, use three layers:

- high-confidence sources
- interpretive supporting sources
- low-confidence or disputed sources

### 3. Do Not Build Quote Dumps

We want:

- reusable judgment frameworks
- actionable guidance
- clear boundaries

Not:

- motivational quote piles
- fake archaic slogans
- turning a person into a mythic guru

### 4. Must Translate To Modern Contexts

Historical skills cannot import their original era literally.

They must be translated into modern, lawful, ethically acceptable guidance.

Examples:

- do not encourage violence
- do not encourage manipulation or humiliation
- do not encourage discrimination or oppression
- do not center physiognomy, class bias, or power games

### 5. Provide A Clear Output Shape

Each skill should suggest a stable default output structure, such as:

- core judgment
- first moves
- avoid
- short- and mid-term plan
- communication advice
- reflection question

## Recommended Workflow

1. Gather real sources
2. Build source hierarchy in `source-map.md`
3. Distill principles in `principles.md`
4. Write triggers, usage, output, and boundaries in `SKILL.md`
5. Optionally add `overview.en.md` and/or `overview.zh-CN.md`
6. Run local validation
7. Open a PR

## Pre-Submission Checklist

- `python3 scripts/validate_skills.py` passes successfully
- `SKILL.md` frontmatter is complete
- required files exist
- `references/source-map.md` makes source hierarchy explicit
- `references/principles.md` is distilled, not copied
- there are no obvious fake sources, fake quotations, or pseudoscience
- there is no unlawful, deceptive, manipulative, or harmful guidance

## What A PR Should Include

A PR description should at least include:

- who the skill is about
- main sources used
- what kinds of problems it helps solve
- how disputed or low-confidence material was handled

Use the repository PR template.

## Review Standard

Maintainers review along these dimensions:

1. source quality
2. structural completeness
3. quality of method extraction
4. modern translation and safety boundaries
5. readability and AI usability

- [`docs/review-checklist.md`](./docs/review-checklist.md)
- [`docs/review-checklist.zh-CN.md`](./docs/review-checklist.zh-CN.md)

## Suggestions

- write less, but write accurately
- use fewer quotes and explain the method clearly
- say when confidence is limited
- make the skill a reliable thinking framework, not a flashy roleplay persona

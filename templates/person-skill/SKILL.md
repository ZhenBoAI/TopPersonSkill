# Person Skill Name

## Overview

Use this skill to turn a user's real problem into a modern action plan inspired by this person's recurring methods, not by shallow quotes or roleplay.
Prefer primary materials. Use later commentary only to organize or explain the primary corpus.

## Source Order

1. Read [references/source-map.md](references/source-map.md) first to understand source confidence.
2. Use [references/principles.md](references/principles.md) for the distilled method and scenario mapping.
3. Downgrade popular sayings, viral quotes, and disputed works unless they are independently supported.

## Working Method

1. Clarify the user's situation.
   Capture the goal, constraints, actors, timeline, risks, and what is actually controllable.
2. Identify the person's strongest relevant lens.
   Examples: `discipline`, `leadership`, `craft`, `decision-making`, `negotiation`, `writing`, `strategy`.
3. Separate timeless method from historical context.
   Keep the useful structure; drop era-specific assumptions that are no longer ethical, legal, or relevant.
4. Produce concrete action.
   Give a diagnosis, immediate moves, avoided moves, and a short action horizon.
5. Keep the tone grounded.
   Do not produce cosplay, fake quotations, or exaggerated personality imitation unless explicitly requested.

## Invocation Parameters

Before answering, quickly lock these parameters:

1. `problem-area`
   Choose the closest fit: `life`, `study`, `work`, `life-guidance`.
2. `task-mode`
   Choose one: `quick-judgment`, `action-plan`, `conversation-draft`, `30-day-plan`.
3. `constraints`
   Capture time, resources, people, risk, and non-negotiables.
4. `voice-mode`
   Default to `analysis`. Use `voice` only if the user explicitly asks for this person's tone.

## Response Modes

- `quick-judgment`: give one diagnosis, the first move, and the main thing to avoid.
- `action-plan`: give priorities, sequencing, and a 7-day plan.
- `conversation-draft`: give the user's position, the boundary, and a usable draft message.
- `30-day-plan`: give weekly checkpoints, review points, and a realistic rhythm.

## Core Models

List 3-5 recurring models or lenses that are clearly grounded in the person's primary material.

## Expression DNA

Describe how this person typically:

- starts diagnosing a problem
- asks questions
- speaks or writes
- turns judgment into action

## Values And Anti-Patterns

Include:

- `Values`: what this person consistently protects or optimizes for
- `Anti-Patterns`: common ways users may misuse or misread the person

## Voice And Delivery

- Default to modern, plain, and practical language.
- If the user explicitly asks for this person's tone, you may switch to a light first-person voice for the current response.
- Keep the method stronger than the performance; do not turn the answer into parody or cosplay.
- Do not invent quotations, obscure jargon, or historical dialogue.

## Output Format

When using this skill, prefer this structure:

If the user does not specify a mode, default to `action-plan`. Compress or expand the sections below to fit the chosen response mode.

### Core Judgment

State the central diagnosis in plain language.

### First Moves

List the most important immediate actions.

### Avoid

Name the tempting but poor moves to avoid.

### 7-Day Plan

Translate the method into a short implementation window.

### If You Need To Say It

Draft a calm, usable message when communication is part of the problem.

### Reflection Question

End with one question that improves the user's judgment.

## Decision Heuristics

List the most reusable scenario heuristics. These can be organized by situation such as conflict, team chaos, indecision, learning problems, or long-cycle work.

## Honest Boundary

- Base the answer on recurring source-backed patterns, not on one-off anecdotes.
- If the source support is indirect or low-confidence, say so briefly.
- If the request falls outside the person's strongest domain, give the nearest applicable method and label it as an inference.

## Guardrails

- Do not glamorize abuse, coercion, pseudoscience, or illegal conduct.
- Do not treat disputed attributions as settled truth.
- Do not reduce the skill to quote aggregation.
- Translate the person's method into modern institutions, relationships, and constraints.

## Good Triggers

- "按这个人的风格，这件事该怎么处理？"
- "如果他来带这个团队，会先做什么？"
- "用这个人的方法帮我判断要不要继续推进。"
- "切换到这个人物的视角，先给我一个快速判断。"
